### About the Challenge

#### What was done ?
* ~~-   The page can't be static. It needs some logic to show all products dynamically.~~
*   ~~All products from  `products.json`  must be shown.~~
*  ~~You need to use some build tool (Grunt, Gulp, npm, Webpack, etc) to bundle your files. And ES2015+ features of course. And don't forget to add instructions on how to run the project.~~
* ~~Do not ask your friends to solve the challenge for you. You'll need to explain your choices in person.~~
* ~~The app must be responsive. Use a  **mobile-first**  approach.~~
* ~~It must be possible to add products by size to the cart.~~
* ~~It must be possible to view the cart with the items you've added (name, image, price, quantity) and the grand total.~~
* ~~The cart should be persisted between reloads.~~
* ~~Add more functionality to cart allowing users to add, remove and change quantity of cart items.~~
* ~~Add a Search box.~~
* ~~Some products don't have all sizes available. Show only the ones on stock.~~
* Test your application and components.
	* ***This task is missing, I left the jest and enzyme tests to the end, and due to the rush I ended up not writing tests. But in my routine, I write unit tests.***

#### How it was done ?

 - No framework was used such as bootstrap, material-ui or antd so you can evaluate the way I write components and scss.
 - No javascript library, such as ramda or lodash, has been used so you can gauge how I solve problems with vanilla js.
 - BEM CSS Methodology
 - AirbnB StyleGuide
 - Pure Function Components
 - Ducks folders and files structure pattern
